# Battle Royale Fixes - Complete Setup Guide

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Shop Auto-Opening
**Problem:** Shop was automatically opening 2 seconds after joining the game  
**Solution:** Removed auto-open behavior from `ShopManager.cs`

### ✅ Issue 2: Escape Key Behavior  
**Problem:** Pressing Escape while in shop showed quit menu instead of closing shop  
**Solution:** Added direct escape key handling in `ShopManager.Update()`

### ✅ Issue 3: Storm Speed Too Fast
**Problem:** Storm/zone was moving too quickly for balanced gameplay  
**Solution:** Applied balanced timing settings via `BattleRoyaleFixManager.cs`

### ✅ Issue 4: Skybox & Water Rendering Issues
**Problem:** Water cutting in/out when jumping from plane, black borders between sky and water at night  
**Solution:** Comprehensive skybox and water fixes via `SkyboxWaterFix.cs`

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
1. Add `BattleRoyaleFixManager.cs` component to any GameObject in your scene
2. All fixes will be applied automatically when the game starts
3. Done! 🎉

### Option 2: Manual Testing
1. Add `ShopFixTester.cs` component to test shop functionality
2. Add `SkyboxWaterTester.cs` component to test visual fixes

### Skybox & Water Rendering:
- ❌ **Before:** Water cut in/out during skydiving
- ✅ **After:** Smooth water rendering at all distances

- ❌ **Before:** Black borders between sky and water at night
- ✅ **After:** Seamless sky-water transition with proper fog

| Setting | Old | New | Improvement |
|---------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Water Scale | 10000x10000 | 5000x5000 | Better precision |
| Camera Far Plane | 1000m | 15000m | No skybox cutoff |
| Fog Density (Night) | 0.015 | 0.008 | No black borders |
| Ambient Light (Night) | 0.3 | 0.4 | Better visibility |
| Skybox Materials | Often missing | Auto-assigned | Consistent visuals |

## 🧪 Testing

### Automatic Testing:
- Add `BattleRoyaleFixManager.cs` to a GameObject
- Use inspector buttons to test individual systems
- Check console for pass/fail results

### Visual Testing Checklist:
1. **Water Rendering Test:** 
   - Jump from plane at high altitude
   - Water should render smoothly without cutting in/out ✅

2. **Night Sky Test:**
   - Switch to night time
   - Check horizon - no black borders between sky and water ✅

3. **Time of Day Test:**
   - Cycle through morning, noon, evening, night
   - Each should have appropriate skybox and fog ✅

4. **Camera Distance Test:**
   - Move camera very far from origin
   - Skybox should remain visible at all distances ✅

### Manual Testing:
1. **Shop Auto-Open Test:** 
   - Start game, wait 5 seconds
   - Shop should NOT open automatically ✅

2. **Escape Key Test:**
   - Press B to open shop
   - Press Escape - shop should close ✅
   - Press Escape again - pause menu should show ✅

3. **Storm Speed Test:**
   - Start multiplayer game
   - First storm should start after 60s (not 30s) ✅
   - Storm should take 30s to shrink (not 20s) ✅

## 🎉 Results

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Water Rendering Fixes:
- Reduced water plane scale from 10000x10000 to 5000x5000 to prevent floating-point precision issues
- Disabled shadow casting on water to eliminate cutting artifacts
- Ensured proper render queue ordering for transparency

### Camera & Skybox Fixes:
- Extended camera far clip plane from 1000m to 15000m to prevent skybox cutoff
- Set camera clear flags to Skybox mode
- Auto-assigned skybox materials for all time-of-day settings

### Fog & Lighting Optimization:
- Reduced night fog density from 0.015 to 0.008 to eliminate black borders
- Increased night ambient intensity from 0.3 to 0.4 for better visibility
- Optimized fog colors for each time period

### Skybox Material Management:
- Implemented automatic skybox material discovery and assignment
- Created fallback procedural skybox when no materials are found
- Enhanced TimeOfDayController with proper material handling

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Shop Won't Close:
1. Check that `_shopPanel` is assigned in ShopManager
2. Verify close button is properly connected
3. Run `ShopFixTester` to diagnose issues

### Water Still Cutting:
1. Ensure `SkyboxWaterFix` component is in your scene
2. Check console for "Water fixes applied" message
3. Verify water scale is 5000x5000 (not 10000x10000)

### Black Borders at Night:
1. Check fog density is below 0.01
2. Verify ambient intensity is above 0.3
3. Test with `SkyboxWaterTester` F3 key

### Storm Still Too Fast:
1. Ensure `BattleRoyaleFixManager` is in your scene
2. Check console for "Storm fixes applied" message
3. Manually call `ApplyAllFixes()` if needed

### Skybox Not Appearing:
1. Check camera far clip plane is above 10000
2. Verify camera clear flags set to Skybox
3. Run skybox material assignment test

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Unity Console for error messages
2. Run the comprehensive test scripts to identify specific problems
3. Ensure all required components are properly assigned
4. Verify Unity version compatibility (tested on Unity 2022.2)

### Quick Diagnostic Commands:
- **F2** = Full skybox/water diagnostic
