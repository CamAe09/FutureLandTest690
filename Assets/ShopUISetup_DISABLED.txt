This file was renamed from ShopUISetup.cs to fix build compilation errors.

The original ShopUISetup.cs contained Unity Editor-specific code that was causing build failures.
A new build-compatible version has been created: ShopUISetup_NEW.cs

If you need the original functionality, use ShopUISetup_NEW.cs instead.

Build errors were:
- PrefabUtility not available in builds
- AssetDatabase not available in builds

These have been fixed in the NEW version by using proper conditional compilation.
